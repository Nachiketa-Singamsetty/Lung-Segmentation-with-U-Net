# Lung Segmentation with U-Net

This repository contains an implementation of lung segmentation using the U-Net deep learning architecture. The model is trained to segment lung regions from chest X-ray images, which is crucial for various medical image analysis tasks.

## 📌 Features
- Implements U-Net for lung segmentation.
- Preprocessing of chest X-ray images.
- Training and evaluation of the model using a dataset.
- Visualization of segmented outputs.
- Performance metrics for evaluation.
